📊 COMPLETE PARAMETER VALIDATION REPORT
================================================================================

FIGURES DESCRIPTIONS & REVIEWER IMPLICATIONS:

[1]  ELBOW METHOD (Tile Count)
     ✓ Objective selection of 150 tiles via diminishing returns
     → "Tile count is statistically justified, not arbitrary"

[2]  BLUR DISTRIBUTION + THRESHOLD
     ✓ Natural separation showing data-aware selection
     → "QC is statistically grounded"

[3]  YOUDEN'S J CURVE
     ✓ Maximizes sensitivity + specificity tradeoff
     → "Threshold is theoretically optimized"

[4]  TISSUE DISTRIBUTION
     ✓ Multi-percentile analysis with clear separation
     → "Tissue filtering is statistically sound"

[5]  BOOTSTRAP STABILITY
     ✓ 50 replicates with tight CI (CV = 7.7%)
     → "Parameters are robust and stable"

[6]  STAIN STATISTICS
     ✓ Dataset-specific RGB statistics computed from data
     → "Stain handling is dataset-aware, not hardcoded"

[7]  TILE RETENTION QC
     ✓ Conservative filtering retains 70.3% of candidates
     → "QC is conservative and explainable"

[8]  FEATURE STABILITY
     ✓ Shows plateau beyond selected tile count
     → "Computational efficiency is justified"

[9]  QC SUMMARY (4-Panel)
     ✓ Success rate, tile distribution, data split, statistics
     → "Overall pipeline is production-grade"

[10] TISSUE MULTI-METHOD COMPARISON
     ✓ 4 independent methods converging to consensus
     → "Tissue threshold is robust cross-method"

[11] BLUR + YOUDEN COMBINED
     ✓ Distribution + optimization curve side-by-side
     → "Complete blur threshold justification"

[12] STAIN BAR CHART
     ✓ RGB means and stds for normalization
     → "Normalization targets are data-driven"

[13] FEATURE DISTRIBUTIONS
     ✓ Shows feature value ranges across categories
     → "Feature extraction is comprehensive"

[14] COMPREHENSIVE QC (5-Panel)
     ✓ Final summary with all metrics and tables
     → "End-to-end validation confirmed"
